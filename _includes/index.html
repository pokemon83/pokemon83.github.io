This homepage is maintained by editing files in the
[git/git.github.io](https://github.com/git/git.github.io) repository on
GitHub.

It is meant to be edited collaboratively like a wiki, except that
instead of a web form, you get to use a text editor and git. What could
be better?

If you want push access, contact peff@peff.net and provide your GitHub
username. You may also send patches by mail (and feel free to cc
git@vger.kernel.org if appropriate).
